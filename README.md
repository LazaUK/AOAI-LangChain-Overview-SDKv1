# LangChain with Azure OpenAI â€“ L300
LangChain is an open-source framework, that you can use to build AI applications, which are utilising capabilities of large language models (LLMs). It provides a set of tools and libraries to simplify the development process, so that you can build context-aware and reasoning applications without deep expertise in LLMs.
LangChain provides functionalities like:

-	**Context awareness**: Integrating LLMs with various data sources.
-	**Reasoning**: Feeding LLMs with contextual data to determine appropriate actions or responses.

LangChain framework helps developers to create various applications:
-	**Chatbots and virtual assistants**: Engaging chat experience.
-	**Document analysis and summarisation**: Extracting key information and generating summaries.
-	**Code analysis**: Assisting with code review, troubleshooting and generation.
